This file explains things which could be done/added to the project.

1.  The graph database visualisation could be done in browser - several ways to do this
2.  Always need new sources of info to connect Person nodes in the graph...  preferably which use ORCID IDs.
    If you have an idea contact us and we will see how we can add it to our graph.
3.  We need ideas to build/improve the reccommendation engine - if you know anything about machine learning or want to learn, get involved!
4.  The python code could be worked into a web app.
5.  Working UI could be created.
